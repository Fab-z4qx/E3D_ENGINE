# E3D_ENGINE
Simple 3D Moteur without 3D Library (Only 2D lib for display vertex) 

This is a school project of 3D Engine programming. The goal was to build and design a 3D engine than use 3D library like openGL or DirectX. 

I did two implementation for the graphical rendering with openCV and SFML. 

Lot of ameliorations can be do like use multiCPU processing or do an implementation that use 3D acceleration.
